Abstract—In this article, we present a 438-479-GHz fully
integrated 25-element radiator array source based on a scalable
structure of coupled standing wave oscillator cells without extra
loss and parasitics from coupling networks. The bandwidth is
extended using a varactor-less frequency tuning method, and
EIRP is improved by increasing the size of the array using the
proposed scalable coupling method and maximizing the radiation
directivity using a silicon lens in an optimized radiation setup.
An analysis of the radiation directivity of a chip-lens setup is
presented as well as the employed approach for enhancing EIRP
by maximizing the directivity. The circuit is implemented in a
65-nm CMOS process and is measured to have 40.7 GHz/8.9%
frequency tuning range. The chip consumes 0.38—2.34-W power
(1.18 W at 459-GHz center frequency) from a 1.2-V supply
voltage. The circuit provides a maximum of —1.8-dBm radiated
power and 19.3-dBm EIRP at 448 GHz using a 12.5-mm radius
silicon lens. The minimum measured phase noise at 10-MHz offset
is —100.6 dBc/Hz. To the best of our knowledge, this article has
the largest EIRP, radiated power, and bandwidth among fully
integrated silicon-based coherent sources above 350 GHz.

I. INTRODUCTION

HE millimeter-wave (mm-wave)/terahertz (THz) spec-

trum offers promising potentials [1], [2] in various appli-
cations such as spectroscopy [3]-[5], imaging [6]—[10], radar
[11], [12], and high-speed communication [13]-[16]. Imple-
menting such systems in reliable low-cost silicon technologies
requires sources that are capable of producing sufficient power
levels in a wide bandwidth. However, several challenges
need to be overcome in this endeavor. As we move toward
the mm-wave/THz band, the maximum oscillation frequency
(fmax) Of the process limits the power that can be generated
by transistors. At the same time, losses of passives in the
circuit increase and poor quality factor of varactors restricts
the frequency of operation and tuning range. Fig. | shows

an overview of the reported levels of radiated power (Praq)
among published state-of-the-art coherent sources in silicon
technology and illustrates the increasing challenge of power
generation and radiation as we approach the THz spectrum.

Frequency multipliers [17]-[19] and harmonic oscilla-
tors [20]-[32] are the main solutions for reaching frequencies
above fmax of the transistors. However, multipliers are gener-
ally more power hungry and less efficient. An array of coherent
harmonic oscillators [5], [6], [20]-[27] is often employed in
order to improve the output power level. Scalability and the
level of extra loss and parasitics penalties are important factors
in the choice of the array structure. Various techniques have
been used in the published literature to synchronize the sources
within an array. Extra quadrature oscillators are used in [5]
to couple the main oscillators of the source. These coupling
oscillators add to the parasitics and power consumption of
the circuit but do not contribute to the radiated power. In [6],
passive coupling is used for oscillators in each row of the array
and individual rows are synchronized through phase locking to
a reference signal by incorporating a phase-locked loop (PLL).
Wireless subharmonic injection locking technique is employed
in [20] which requires an additional fundamental frequency
(100 GHz) external radiation source. In [26], a reference signal
is symmetrically routed and used for injection locking of the
sources in the array after going through phase-shifting and
multiplication stages. We previously demonstrated in [25] the
potential advantages of employing a standing wave oscillator
(SWO) for scalable and wideband THz power generation.

As the frequency approaches the THz spectrum, the dimin-
ishing size of the antennas as well as the increasing loss of

off-chip power extraction both enable and force us to employ
on-chip antennas for direct radiation of the output power.
However, there are important challenges in implementing
integrated planar antennas. The low-resistivity silicon substrate
traps a major part of the radiation energy inside it through
excitation of surface waves. This can significantly degrade
the radiation efficiency of on-chip antennas [33]—[35]. Several
solutions have been proposed and implemented in the literature
to address this issue. Using a ground plane to isolate the
antenna from the lossy substrate is one possibility [22]—[25].
However, the small thickness of back-end oxide layers limits
the performance of these antennas. In this case, directivity (D)
and efficiency can be improved by incorporating a superstrate
on top of the chip [8], [36]. Alternatively, substrate-thinning
can be used to prevent the substrate from supporting the
excitation of lossy surface waves [26]. Using a silicon lens
is another method for back-side radiation from the chip [5],
[6], [19], [29], [30]. Attaching a silicon lens to the substrate
significantly improves the directivity as well as increasing the
radiation efficiency by suppressing the surface waves in the
substrate. Despite its popular use, the radiation behavior of
an array in a chip-lens configuration has not been adequately
explored.

In this work, we implemented a wideband high-EIRP source
by employing a scalable array structure whose dimensions
can be extended without introducing extra parasitics or losses
to the circuit. SWO unit cells (UCells) are employed as the
array building blocks and are coupled together without added
passive loss or parasitics in a scalable structure. A varactor-
less frequency tuning mechanism is used to extend the circuit
bandwidth. The EIRP is increased by both raising the total
power that is delivered to the antennas and the array’s radiation

the proposed scalable structure and directivity 1s maximized
by employing a wideband on-chip antenna with a silicon lens
in an optimized radiation setup. We demonstrate in this article
that the physical choices for the lens-based radiation setup
have a significant impact on the directivity and EIRP of the
circuit.

In this article, Section II describes the UCell of the array as
well as the employed scalable coupling method and the struc-
ture of the implemented array. The design of the integrated
antenna and characteristics of the lens-based radiation setup
are discussed in Section III. The experimental results of this
article are presented in Section IV, and Section V brings this
article to a conclusion.

Il. ARRAY STRUCTURE AND DESIGN

The implemented array consists of SWO UCells that are
coupled together in a continuous and scalable structure with
no extra coupling loss and integrated antennas for radiation of
the generated coherent THz power. This section describes the
UCell of the array circuit as well as the employed scalable
coupling scheme.

A. Array’s UCell

Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows the schematic and implementation
structure of the array’s UCell, respectively. It consists of a
harmonic SWO and a folded slot antenna for radiation of the
extracted fourth harmonic power through the back side of the
chip. The operation principle of the UCell’s SWO is similar
to that described in [32]. However, unlike [32], the UCells are
coupled together in a way that makes it possible to construct a

scalable array structure. We will discuss the coupling scheme
in detail in Section II-B. Furthermore, the oscillator is designed
to maximize the fourth harmonic power radiation through
on-chip antennas instead of second harmonic probe-based
extraction in [32].

Out-of-phase fundamental frequency (fo) standing waves
are formed on the gate transmission lines (TLg) which results
in systematic cancellation of fundamental frequency power
and all its odd harmonics. This creates virtual ground planes
across the lines of symmetry in the circuit at fo and its
odd harmonics. Fig. 3(a) shows the equivalent circuit of
the SWO at fo. The short-terminated drain transmission line
(TLp) creates an inductive drain impedance. The transistors
with inductive drain impedance provide the necessary negative
resistance (R.q) for oscillation at their gate terminals. Fig. 3(b)
shows the simulated (R.,)~' in the SWO circuit. The transis-
tors are placed at the anti-nodes of the TLg standing waves
and therefore experience the maximum oscillation amplitude
at their gate terminals. The harmonics of the fundamental
frequency are therefore generated through the nonlinearity of
the transistors. In addition to loss compensation and harmonic
generation, transistors are used as active variable capacitors
for frequency tuning in order to avoid the unwanted loss and
parasitics of varactors. Looking at the resonance circuit at
node X in Fig. 3(a), the negative resistance of the transistor
(Req) cancels the losses in the circuit (modeled here by a
lumped resistor Rj oss) and the frequency of oscillation 1s
determined by the input capacitance of the transistor (Ceq)

and the inductance of The (Leq). Therefore, the frequency
of operation can be altered by changing the gate bias (Vc)
of the transistor and therefore varying the capacitor in the
oscillator’s resonance circuit. Fig. 3(c) shows the simulated
Ceq for different gate bias levels from 0.35 to 1.1 V in the
circuit. It can be seen in Fig. 3(b) that Rg remains negative for
this range of Vg values. The Vg bias voltage is applied at the
nodes of the standing waves with zero fundamental frequency
amplitude, thus avoiding any unwanted loading effect of the
bias circuitry on the ac operation of the circuit. We have
previously presented a detailed analysis of the operation of
the SWO and the employed frequency tuning mechanism for
a SiGe HBT implementation in [25].

Due to the out-of-phase formation of standing waves on
the top and bottom TLg, the phases of fundamental frequency
oscillation at transistors’ gates are either O° or 180°. This is
shown in Fig. 2(a). This means that while the fundamental fre-
quency power and its odd harmonics cancel out, the generated
even harmonics are in phase and add up constructively. The
desired fourth harmonic (4/09) powers are combined and fed
to the on-chip folded slot antenna for radiation. The second
harmonic radiation is suppressed by the input matching and
radiation efficiency of the antenna at that frequency. The
detailed characterization of the integrated antenna 1s presented
in Section III.

Fig. 2(b) shows the implementation detail of the array’s
UCell. The TLg and TLp transmission lines are implemented

(at 4 fo) that is used to apply the supply voltage (Vpp) are
implemented by the top AP layer. Universal gnd and Vpp
planes are implemented using M3 and M2 metal layers,
respectively. The top and bottom TLg transmission lines
are terminated on opposite sides by capacitor C7. Ideally,
we require this capacitor to be large enough to create a
close-to-short impedance while being insensitive to process
variations. An imbalance between Cy magnitudes on opposite
sides of TLg can create an unwanted phase error and reduce
the output power. Therefore, the top and bottom Cy are
implemented as large M1-M2 parallel-plane capacitors that
each occupy half the area underneath the UCell. The UCell
circuit is laid out in a way so as to create the necessary space
for the integrated antennas between cells while preserving
symmetry and minimizing the routing path loss of the output
power. The entire structure of the SWO is electromagneti-
cally simulated altogether and used in the design process.

power consumption, and output power (delivered to the
antenna) of the SWO UCell.

EIRP (dBm) = P; (dBm) + G, (dB)
= P, (dBm) + D; (dB) + era (dB) = (1)

where D,; and @;aq are the transmitter’s overall directivity and
radiation efficiency, respectively. We will discuss our approach
to maximizing G, in detail in Section III. The transmit power
(P,;), on the other hand, can be improved by increasing the
number of coupled UCells and forming an array of sources
that generate in-phase THz power. This coupling also has a
desirable effect in reducing the phase noise of each individual
oscillator [37]. Oscillators are often coupled together using
passive elements. However, these coupling networks come
with losses and parasitics that negatively affect the frequency
of operation, tuning range, and output power of the UCell. Our
approach in this work avoids extra loss and parasitics by using
a new continuous and scalable method of extending the array
size in 2-D while maintaining coherency of the generated THz
power.

Fig. 4(a) illustrates the operation principle of the employed
coupling method. Here, the bottom middle link (Link BM) acts
as a bridge between the top left and right links (Link TL and
Link TR) and maintains 0°/180° phase relation between them
even though Link TL and Link TR are not directly coupled
together. A two-wavelength standing wave is formed on the
gate transmission line in Link BM which enforces 0°/180°

phase operation on the transistors in Link BM. At the same
time, half of Link BM (BM_I) 1s coupled to Link TL and the
other half (BM_II) to Link TR using TLp transmission lines.
This ensures that TL_II and TR_I are out of phase since BM_I
and BM_II have to be out of phase. If we continue with this
structure, Link TL and Link TR will, in turn, preserve the same
phase relationship between Link BM and its adjacent Links on
the left and right sides (Link BL and Link BR), respectively.
We can therefore extend the array to our desired size in a row
without adding any extra passive elements to or between the
UCells.

Since the top and bottom halves of the row are shifted by
one wavelength relative to each other, there will be “half-cells”
on both sides of the row whose TLp lines are left uncoupled.
Therefore, our next step 1s to extend the size of the array in
the second dimension using these “half-cells” as hinges that
couple successive rows together. This is shown in Fig. 4(b)
where two rows are coupled together using the “hinge” cell
on the right. Similarly, other rows can be added before or after
these two rows by coupling them to half-cells on the left side
of the structure. Therefore, we can scale both the number
of columns (by extending the rows) and rows (by coupling
multiple rows) in the array to our desired size without adding
any coupling loss or parasitics to the circuit and maintain
the 0°/180° phase relationship for fundamental frequency and
coherent fourth harmonic power generation and radiation.

Fig. 5 shows the full structure of the implemented array.
The integrated antennas are placed in the empty spaces that
are specifically created for this purpose by laying out both
gate and drain transmission lines diagonally. We should point
out that this area is sufficiently large for a patch antenna at

0.46 THz as well. Therefore, the folded slot antennas can be
potentially replaced by patch antennas in case lens-less front-
side radiation is desired instead. The core of the circuit consists
of a 4 x 5 array and “hinge-cells’” A, B, and C couple the
rows together. “Dummy-cells” A and B are unavoidable at
the beginning and end of the continuous structure but will
not increase in number regardless of the size of the entire
array. Since these dummy cells are not facing another half-
cell, the drain transmission lines are coupled together. We do
not expect any significant mismatch effect because of these
dummy cells.

II. INTEGRATED RADIATION STRUCTURE

Silicon lenses are often used in THz sources to minimize the
surface wave losses in the substrate and concentrate the radi-
ated power into narrow beams, thereby increasing the radiation
gain and hence EIRP [38], [39]. In this section, we explore the
behavior of the on-chip antenna/array and Si lens configuration
and present the optimum physical conditions for this radiation
mechanism that can maximize EIRP.

A. Single Antenna + Lens Radiation

We have employed folded slot antennas for radiation of
the THz power through the substrate and silicon lens. This
choice offers several benefits including high directivity that
directly increases the EIRP of the source and large bandwidth.
Furthermore, the slot structure of the antenna minimizes the
negative impact of the necessary local density filling cells
on the radiation efficiency of the source. Fig. 6(a) shows the
attachment configuration of the silicon lens with radius Rjens

has been shown in [39] that La. ~ 0.36 x Rien, results in
maximum directivity. Fig. 6(e) and (f) shows the simulated
Dyax (Maximum directivity), @;aq (radiation efficiency), and
maximum gain (Gmax) of the folded slot antenna for different
values of Lex, respectively. A maximum directivity of 31.9 dBi
can be achieved with Ley, = 1.4 mm and Ley/ Rens = 0.34.
It can be seen that there is about 17.1-dB difference between
directivity with Lex, = 1.4 mm and Ley, = 0.3 mm.

In addition to the choice of Lex, the size of the lens has an
important effect on the radiation characteristic of the antenna.
To explore the impact of the lens size, we simulated the folded
slot antenna with three different lens sizes while sweeping Lex
for each one of them. Fig. 6(g) shows the simulated maximum
radiation directivity (Dmax) versus Lex for lens radii of 4,
5, and 6 mm. It can be seen that the maximum directivity
increases with the lens radius. Furthermore, the optimum value
of Lex, changes with the lens size as well. This is consistent
with our expectation of best Lex occurring at a constant
Lext/ Riens. Based on the presented results, we can conclude
that the directivity and EIRP of the source can be increased

by using a larger lens while choosing the optimum Lex based
on the employed lens size.

As shown in Fig. 3(d), the UCell is capable of providing
~30 GHz of tuning range and therefore the antenna behavior
as a function of frequency is of interest. Fig. 7(a) shows
the simulated maximum gain and directivity as well as radi-
ation efficiency of the antenna as a function of frequency
for Lexy m= 1.5 mm and Rep = 5 mm. The value of
Lext 18 Chosen to be 1.5 mm instead of the optimum value
of 1.4 mm since we had access to 0.5-mm-thick wafers during
the measurement. Fig. 7(b) shows the input matching of the
antenna with $;; below —10 dB within the bandwidth of the
circuit. The simulation results presented in Fig. 7 are based
on the simulation setup shown in Fig. 6(b). Modeling the Si
wafer and lens as a semi-infinite silicon boundary condition
underneath the chip substrate can reduce the simulation time
and speed up the design process. However, the impedance
simulation results deviate from the more realistic setup as
shown in Fig. 7(b). Furthermore, the semi-infinite boundary
condition predicts the radiation efficiency to be close to 50%,
while the more accurate simulation in Fig. 7(a) shows the

B. Antenna Array + Lens Radiation

Even though many works in the literature use Si lens
for THz array radiation [3], [5]-[7], [28], [43], the radia-
tion characteristics of an array-lens configuration have rarely
been explored. In order to maintain the generality of results,
we present our analysis here based on a more conventional
4 x 4 symmetrical array. This array consists of the same
folded slot antennas with the same horizontal and vertical
antenna spacings as the implemented array. Similar to the

case of a single antenna, we start by looking at the effect
of Lext on the radiation behavior of the array. Fig. 8 shows
the radiation patterns of the array with a 5-mm-radius lens and
for three different values of extension lengths. As expected,
similar to the single antenna, the choice of extension length
plays an important role in determining the directivity and
therefore EIRP of the source. Fig. 9(a) shows the maximum
directivity (Dmax) and directivity at 0 = 180° (see Fig. 8)
along the lens’s center axis (Do) for this 4 x 4 array for
different values of Lex. The maximum directivity is equal to
21.4 dBi at Lext = 2 mm. Fig. 9(b) compares the Dax for the
scenarios of a single antenna, a 2 x 2 and a4 x4 array. We can
see that the variations of Dmax with Lex; and the peak value
of Dmax decrease as we extend the array. However, Dax can
still be increased by 6.7 dB by simply changing Ley, from 150

um to 2 mm in a 4 x 4 array. We can also see in Fig. 9(a)
that for most of the values of L.x4, Do is smaller than Dymaox.
This means that if the lens is aligned with the center of the
array footprint, the peak of the radiated beam will no longer
be at 0 = 180°. This scenario is clearly shown in the case of
Lext = 150 um in Fig. 8.

The maximum array directivity (Dmax) of the 4 x 4 array
with Rjens = 5 mm and L,,, = 2 mm is 21.4 dBi, while Dyax
of a single antenna with the same Rien, and Lexy = 1.4 mm 1s
31.9 dBi. In other words, counter-intuitively, the radiation gain
decreases when the lens is fed by an array of antennas rather
than a single one. In a conventional lens-less radiation setup,
the directivity would increase by 10log(NV), where WN is the
number of array elements. Furthermore, a similar increase in
the total transmit power (P;) gives a net increase of 20log(V)
to the EIRP. In this case, however, directivity has dropped
by 10.5 dB instead even though the number of antennas and
the total transmit power is increased by 12 dB. In other
words, we have increased P, at the expense of array gain
and we, therefore, do not observe the double boosting effects
of array formation on both power and gain. The maximum
radiation gain of the 4 x 4 folded slot antenna array with
lens at Lex = 2 mm and Ri, = 5 mm is about 15.6 dBi.

ice.

A designed 4 x 4 patch antenna array with the necessary
local metal fillings underneath the antenna has a maximum
gain of about 12.4 dBi. Therefore, employing a lens-coupled
radiation structure is still beneficial despite the drop in the
directivity. Furthermore, we go on to demonstrate here that
the magnitude of this drop in directivity can be reduced by
increasing the size of the lens.

The reason for the drop in the gain of the array compared
to a single antenna is rooted in the positions of array elements
relative to the center of the lens. The simulation results
presented in Section III-A were all based on the assumption
that the center of the antenna is perfectly aligned to the center
of the lens. In an array, however, even if the lens is perfectly
aligned with the center of the array’s footprint, most of the
array elements would have an off-axis displacement (Lgis)
relative to the lens center. Therefore, if we look at each antenna
in the array individually, they would have different radiation
patterns from each other and from the ideal aligned case. The
effect of this displacement for a single antenna is studied
in [40] and it has been shown that this misalignment results
in steering of the radiation beam. This phenomenon has been
intentionally exploited in [41] to perform beam steering by
mechanically moving the lens relative to the source antenna.

antenna array. It can be seen that the beam steers away from
the center axis in the E- and H-planes as the antenna is mis-
placed in the x- and y-directions, respectively. The radiation
patterns of the antennas that are further away from the center
of the array experience even larger deviation from the center.
Therefore, different antennas in the array are radiating the
power in different directions. This behavior has an important
and undesirable effect on the maximum directivity and EIRP
of an array source with a lens. The radiation pattern of the
array is determined by the superposition of radiation patterns
of individual antennas with different displacements relative to
the center of the lens. So, unlike a lens-less array, the gain from
each antenna 1s not maximum at 0 = 180°. Therefore, not only
the array directivity does not increase with 1Olog(V) but also it
drops compared to the single-antenna case. This phenomenon
is inevitable in a lens-array setup. However, we expect that
its effect can be minimized by increasing the lens size (Riens)
since the steering angle of an individual antenna is directly
related to its relative displacement Lgis/Rjens [40]. In order
to verify this, we simulated the folded slot antenna for three
different lens sizes. The result is shown in Fig. 9(c) with
Dmax = 19, 21.4, and 22.2 dBi for Re, = 4, 5, and 6

sizes 1s restricted by the available processing power. However,
we can conclude from Fig. 9(c) that using a larger Si lens can
increase the EIRP of the source by increasing the maximum
directivity of a single antenna [as shown in Fig. 6(g)] and also
minimizing the unwanted steering due to the misalignment of
array elements with the lens.

To summarize, the wrong choice of Lex, can easily result
in much lower EIRP than potentially possible from the same
circuit. This is particularly significant since power genera-
tion at mm-wave/THz spectrum is quite costly. Furthermore,
increasing the size of the array without increasing the size
of the lens accordingly can actually be counter-productive
for EIRP, which would mean a larger chip area and higher
power consumption with no or even negative impact on the
performance.

Separate universal gnd and supply voltage (Vpp) planes cover
the entire area underneath the chip using M3 and M2 metal
layers, respectively. Moreover, a large number of gnd and
supply pads (22 pads for each) are symmetrically placed on
top and bottom of the chip to further minimize any undesired
effect due to bias mismatch between array cells. The gate
bias routing is done symmetrically underneath the gnd and
Vpp planes using the M1 metal layer so as to minimize any
undesired coupling to the passive structures of the array cells.

Fig. 12(a) shows the configuration of the measured pro-
totype systems. A 500-jm-thick undoped high-resistivity
(>15 KQ-cm) silicon wafer with | in diameter was glued
to the back side of an FR4 PCB with a hole in the middle.
The chip was then attached to the wafer inside the hole area of
the board. Therefore, the front side of the chip is exposed and
gate bias and supply voltages are applied to the circuit through
bond wires that connect the PCB tracks to the chip’s pads.
A high-resistivity hemispherical silicon lens is attached to the
other side of the wafer. Fig. 12(b) shows the measurement
setup of the chip. On the receiver side, a VDI WR2.2 horn
antenna captures the beam followed by an Erickson power
meter for EIRP and radiated power (P,aq) measurement and a

Fig. 12(c) shows a snapshot of the measurement setup where
the lens is placed inside the XY translation mount device and
its position 1s adjusted based on the received power by the
EHM.

In order to experimentally find the best choice for Lex,
we altered Lex, by adding 500-uwm-thick wafers between the
Si lens and the original wafer that is attached to the board.
For each value of Lext, we re-adjusted the lens position to
maximize the received power by the EHM and recorded
its magnitude for different values of Lex; for comparison.
We carried out this procedure for two separate lenses with
Rens = 5 mm and Rens = 12.5 mm. For Reps = 5 mm
[Fig. 13(a)], the received power levels versus Lex for different
distances (d) between the transmitter chip and the receiver
antenna are shown in Fig. 13(b). It can be seen that maximum
power is received with Lexy = 1.5 mm. We therefore carried
out the rest of the measurements for Rien, = 5 mm with this
choice of Lex. We then proceeded to measure the received
power versus d in order to find the appropriate far-field
distance by comparing its variation with the Friis transmission
equation. The measured normalized received power versus dis-

tance is shown in Fig. 13(c). It shows that the radiated power

follows the Friis equation from about d = 14 cm. Therefore,
we used this distance for far-field measurements of the array,
including characterizations of radiation patterns, EIRP, and
Praq. Fig. 13(d) and (e) shows the measured radiation patterns
of the array at a 14 cm distance in the E- and H-planes,
respectively.

Following a similar procedure for Rjenps = 12.5 mm
[Fig. 14(a)], we found the optimum value for Lex to be 2 mm
as shown in Fig. 14(b) and the far-field distance to be about
20 cm as shown in Fig. 14(c). Fig. 14(d) and (e) shows the
measured radiation patterns of the array with Rjeps = 12.5 mm
at 20 cm distance in the E- and H-planes, respectively.

Fig. 15(a) shows the measured and simulated frequency of
the radiated power for l- and 1.2-V supply voltages. The
frequency can be altered from 438.4 to 479.1 GHz with a
1.2-V supply which is equivalent to 8.9% tuning range. The
EIRP of the circuit is measured using the received power by
the power meter and based on Friis equation and is shown
in Fig. 15(b) and (c) for Riens = 5 mm and Rien, = 12.5 mm
with maximum levels of 14.8 dBm at 453 GHz and 19.3 dBm
at 448 GHz, respectively. Fig. 15(b) also shows an estimation
of the expected EIRP based on the simulated values for
output power of a single UCell, the radiation efficiency of
the folded slot antenna, and the directivity of a 4 x 4 array
with Lexs = 1.5 mm and Rens = 5 mm. We can see that the
measured results follow the simulated values closely. Based on
the measured radiation patterns of the array in Figs. 13 and 14,
the directivity, calculated using a similar approach as in [5],
is 16.8 and 21.14 dBi for Rien, = 5 mm and Rien, = 12.5 mm,
respectively. The radiated power (P,aq) can then be calculated
based on the measured EIRP and directivity [Praq (dBm) =
EIRP (dBm) — Directivity (dB)]. The peak values of Praq are
—2.1 and —1.8 dBm for Rjens = 5 mm and Rjep,s = 12.5 mm,
respectively.

The measured power consumption of the circuit across the
bandwidth of operation is shown in Fig. 15(d). The chip
consumes between 380 mW at 479.1 GHz and 2.34 W at
438.4 GHz from a 1.2-V supply. The power consumption at
448 GHz with maximum EIRP is 1.47 W. Fig. 15(e) shows
the measured phase noise of the radiated power within the
bandwidth of the circuit at 1O0-MHz offset frequency. The
minimum phase noise level 1s — 100.6 dBc/Hz at 445 GHz and
Fig. 15(f) shows the measured spectrum of the phase noise at
this frequency.

Table I presents a performance summary of this article and
a comparison with the state of the art and shows that we were
able to simultaneously achieve large bandwidth and high EIRP
well above fmax 1n a fully integrated silicon implementation.
To our knowledge, this article has the highest EIRP and
radiated power (P,aq) and the largest frequency tuning range
among fully integrated silicon-based coherent sources above
350 GHz.

V. CONCLUSION

In this article, we presented a 0.46-THz fully integrated
radiator array circuit in a 65-nm CMOS process. We used a
scalable structure to extend the size of the array. This structure
consists of coupled standing wave harmonic oscillators without

extra loss and parasitics due to the coupling of oscillators.
The radiation directivity is maximized by employing an opti-
mized lens integrated radiation setup and a wide bandwidth
of operation was achieved using a varactor-less frequency
tuning method. As a result, to the best of our knowledge,
the implemented circuit demonstrates the highest EIRP and
radiated power (P,aq) and the largest frequency tuning range
among fully integrated silicon-based coherent sources above
350 GHz.
